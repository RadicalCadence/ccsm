Primitive Synthesis
*******************

There are multitudes of synthesis methods, but the most common ones have the
same basic components: *oscillators*, *filters*, and *envelopes*. Oscillators
generate sound, filters will add or remove tonal qualities of the oscillators,
and envelopes control the properties of oscillators and filters. Each of these
components can be combined in several different ways, creating classic
*synthesis methods*.

Oscillators 
===========

.. todo:: This chapter will cover basic synthesis topics, including
   oscillators, filters, and envelopes. Should include code and sound examples!
