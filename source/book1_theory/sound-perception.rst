.. todo:: Complete the 'Sound Perception' chapter.

   Be sure to include auditory illusions such as Shepard tones and the McGurk
   effect. The latter is important because it highlights how other senses can
   affect auditory perception.

   Also to be included is inferred fundamental frequencies, which is important
   in relation to mixing of sound sources and how the brain can still identify
   instruments even if they have been EQed to fit within the mix.

   Beat frequencies as well! This should reference the phase interference
   section.
